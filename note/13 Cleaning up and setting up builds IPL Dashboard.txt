13 Cleaning up and setting up builds IPL Dashboard



NOTES:
1. React application build output is a static webpage, which consist of html, css, js, and some static files like img, png, etc
	> this means that we can easily serve either in a dedicated server like NGINX or even in Spring Boot
2. When we are rendering a list of Component (mapped from a list of objects via map()), then it is important to provide a "key" property to the Component render
	> this helps the ReactJS when it comes to tracking and updating a specific component
