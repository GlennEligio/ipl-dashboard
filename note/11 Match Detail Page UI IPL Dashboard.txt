11 Match Detail Page UI IPL Dashboard

GOALS:
1. Style the MatchPage component
2. Create the two components of MatchPage
	> YearSelector
	> Matches list
3. Render them using CSS grid
4. Pass the teamName in YearSelector component
	> we will add logic in YearSelector to change the URI to another date



NOTES:
1. It is a best practice to choose the correct HTML element tag to match the semantics of the said component
	> ex: if its a list, its better to use <ul> <ol> <li> rather than <div> since its much clearer to read and understand when reading the source code
