15 Recap IPL Dashboard


Process thoughts with creating the IPL Dashboard includes:
1. Make rough sketches of the App to create
2. Fetch a data set to use for Application from Kaggel
3. Create a system design, as to what tools we will use to create the app	
	> we decided to use an embedded database since the data is static
	> we also used Spring Batch to batch process the CSV file dataset and populate the database
	> we used Spring Boot with Spring Web to expose endpoints to serve data from database
	> we also design the frontend UI to be used by users using ReactJS
