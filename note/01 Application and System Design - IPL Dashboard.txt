01 Application and System Design - IPL Dashboard

IPL Dashboard
 > application to see the IPL data, which include
	- teams
	- matches
	- timeline


Application and System Designs Steps
1. UI/UX designs
2. Dataset that we will use
	> this will affect everything in our application



Kaggle
 > Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.
 > we will be using this to get the IPL dataset



System Design
1. Spring Boot app will have the following components
	> In memory database
	> CSV file that we will use to as dataset
	> Spring batch to process CSV file to populate db
2. React frontend will connect to a Loadbalancer that redirects request to any Spring Boot app instance




NOTES:
1. Steps when creating an application
 	> USER REQUIREMENT
	> USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN
	> PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
	> SYSTEM DESIGN
	> CODE WRITING
2. For application that have "static" data (where we will only "read" the data and not write), then its better to do an in-memory database
